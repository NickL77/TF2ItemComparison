# TF2ItemComparison
Project to look for discrepancies in the price of tf2 items in the STEAM Marketplace and trading sites. The idea is to profit from the difference of prices in in-game currency (metal and keys) and in dollars (on the STEAM Market).

Project is on hold due to lack of time and lack of ease to get STEAM marketplace data without being blocked as a spammer.
